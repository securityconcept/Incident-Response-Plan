Incident Response Plan-Ransomware

Below is a detailed point by point explanation for the Steps related to handling ransomware incidents, categorized into Preparation, Identification,

Containment, Eradication, Recovery and Lesson learned

Preparation:

1-Regularly update and apply patches to all software and systems to fix security vulnerabilities.

2-Conduct frequent checks on security controls and defensive mechanisms to ensure they are functioning correctly.

3-Verify that backup files are not infected by scanning them with updated antivirus software.

4-Acquire and securely store decryption keys for known rasomware strains.

5-Ensure that our cybersecurity insurance policy covers ransomware incidents and associated costs.

6-Regularly perform simulated ransomware attacks to test and improve our response plans.

7-Simulate phishing attacks to train employees on recognizing and avoiding phishing emails.

8-Provide continuous cybersecurity training to employees to improve their awareness and response to threats.

9-Audit and tighten access permissions on file shares to prevent unauthroized access.

10-Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) applications are always up to date.

11-Implement network segmentation to limit the spread of ransomware within the network.

12-Monitor and log traffic between different network segments for abnormal activity.

13-Test backup restoration processes regularly to ensure they work as expected.

14-Set up and maintain a cryptocurrency account to pay ransoms if necessary.

====================================================================================================================

Identification:

1-Look for ransom notes or messages left by ransomware on infected systems.

2-Detect changes in file extensions that indicate encryption.

3-Investigate user complaints about inaccessible or corrupted files.

4-Monitor and block emails with potentially malicious attachments.

5-Identify abnormal DNS queries that may indicate communication with command and control (C2) servers.

6-Detect rapid changes in file names that may indicate mass encryption.

7-Monitor for sudden increases in CPU usage on file servers, a potential sign of encryption activity.

8-Identify and investigate unknown or suspicious executable files running on user systems.

9-Look for unusual network connections originating from infected hosts.

10-Monitor firewall logs for blocked attempts to access file-sharing services.

11-Detect connections to known malicious IPs associated with ransomware.

12-Review and respond to intrusion detection/prevention system alerts related to ransomware.

13-Investigate alerts from antivirus and endpoint detection and response tools.

14-Use threat intelligence feeds to correlate and validate alerts.


====================================================================================================================

Containment

1-Use threat intelligence feeds to correlate and validate alerts.

2-Apply appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the impact of the ransomware attack.

3-Follow the OODA loop to make informed decisions quickly during the incident.Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act

4-Identify and disconnect devices that are actively encrypting data.

5-Disconnect affected file shares from the network to prevent further spread.

6-Identify and eliminate the entry point used by the ransomware.

7-Strengthen the security of unaffected file shares to prevent further attacks.

8-Enhance protection measures for critical systems that have not been affected.

9-Block external IPs and domains associated with the threat actors.

10-Use EDR tools to find and stop malicious processes on infected machines.

=======================================================================================================================

Eradication:

1-Ensure the initial entry point is permanently secured.

2-Apply patches to fix any exploited vulnerabilities.

3-Reinstall the operating system and applications on compromised devices.

4-Check all systems for indicators of compromise related to the ransomware attack.

5-Analyze user activity logs for suspicious actions linked to the attack.

6-Verify that backups are clean before restoring systems.

7-Update security tools with new threat signatures to detect and block future attacks.

========================================================================================================================

Recovery:

1-Recover systems to the recovery point objective (RPO) within the recovery time objective (RTO).

2-Use verified clean backups to restore affected systems.

3-Repair any additional damage caused by the ransomware attack.

==========================================================================================================================

Lesson Learned:

1-Continuously maintain and improve cybersecurity practices.

2-Educate users to recognize and avoid phishing attempts.

3-Train users to be cautious of unexpected attachments, even from known contacts.
